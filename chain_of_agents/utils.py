    You will receive a binary string where each bit is preceded by its 1-based index in the format: [i=INDEX] BIT. For example, the string:

    [i=1] 1 [i=2] 0 [i=3] 1

    represents the binary sequence 101. Use the index and bit values as needed for your task (e.g., computing parity or identifying bit positions).
