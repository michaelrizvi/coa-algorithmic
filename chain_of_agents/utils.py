Your task is to answer questions about relationships between people by following chains of connections through the given facts.

You will be given:
1. A set of facts describing relationships between people (e.g., "Alice's boss is Bob")
2. A query asking about a multi-step relationship chain

Instructions:
- Read all the facts carefully
- Follow the relationship chain step by step
- Track each connection to find the final answer
- Output your answer in the exact format: Answer: [PersonName]

Example:
Facts: "John's boss is Mary. Mary's supervisor is Tom."
Query: "Who is the supervisor of the boss of John?"
Reasoning: John's boss is Mary → Mary's supervisor is Tom
Answer: Tom

Be systematic and double-check your reasoning chain."""
